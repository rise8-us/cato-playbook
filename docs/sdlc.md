# 7. Converge RMF with your SDLC

We covered this throughout the document, but here is a quick summary:

**People**
- Integrated cybersecurity culture (cross-functional teams)
- Technical assessors (from your performer, or from your AO’s contract(s))

**Process**
- Perform all RMF steps
- Create Living documentation by way of your SDLC toolsuite
- Follow NIST Guidance + create an ongoing authorization playbook
- Establish continuous delivery, with metrics for high quality and reduced risk

**Technology / Automation**
- Implement high common controls inheritance via opinionated cloud platform
- Modern Security Requirements Management (e.g. Tracer or SD Elements)
- Static Application & Dependency Vulnerability Scanning (e.g. Snyk)
- Image Scanning (e.g. Aqua)
- Container Scanning (e.g. Aqua)
