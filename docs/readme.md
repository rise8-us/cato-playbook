README: Please first read our Manifesto for a Continuous Delivery Risk Management Framework (CD-RMF)©. To advance that cause, we are making our internal playbook available to the entire govtech community. 

This is v1, and we would love your feedback. We had to significantly modify our internal playbook to make it applicable to a wider audience, but we struggled to balance how deep to go on basics as well as how much of NIST documentation to rehash. Feedback there would be especially helpful.

In return for sharing this, we ask you to use it for good and contribute back. Use it to communicate the benefits beyond just being able to ship software faster, but as a means to improve security and privacy outcomes while enabling continuous delivery. Get leaders to invest in continuous improvement of RMF.

When you do, share your new implementations, plays, automations, and lessons learned! While the terms of [CC BY-ND 4.0](http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nd/4.0/?ref=chooser-v1) allow reusers to copy and distribute the material in unadapted form only, we will be creating a formal open source community around the playbook, and will provide ways for you to contribute to the material, be listed as a contributor, and make the community better. More to follow on that!

***Together, we rise!***
